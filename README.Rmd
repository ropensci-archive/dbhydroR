`dbhydroR` provides scripted access to the South Florida Water Management District's DBHYDRO database which holds over 35 million hydrologic and water quality records from the Florida Everglades and surrounding areas. 

## Installation

### Stable version from CRAN

`install.packages("dbhydroR")`

### or development version from Github

`install.packages("devtools") # Requires RTools if using Windows`

`devtools::install_github("ropensci/dbhydroR")`

## Usage

### Load dbhydroR

`library("dbhydroR")`

### Water Quality Data

Station IDs and date ranges can be viewed in the [Environmental Monitoring Location Maps](https://www.sfwmd.gov/documents-by-tag/emmaps). Test names can be viewed in the [Data Types Metadata Table](https://my.sfwmd.gov/dbhydroplsql/show_dbkey_info.show_data_type_info).

#### One variable at one station
```
get_wq(station_id = "FLAB08", date_min = "2011-03-01", 
      date_max = "2012-05-01", test_name = "CHLOROPHYLLA-SALINE")
```

#### One variable at multiple stations 
```
get_wq(station_id = c("FLAB08","FLAB09"), date_min = "2011-03-01",
      date_max = "2012-05-01", test_name = "CHLOROPHYLLA-SALINE")
```

#### One variable at a wildcard station
```
get_wq(station_id = c("FLAB0%"), date_min = "2011-03-01", 
      date_max = "2012-05-01", test_name = "CHLOROPHYLLA-SALINE")
```

#### Multiple variables at multiple stations
```
get_wq(station_id = c("FLAB08","FLAB09"), date_min = "2011-03-01",
      date_max = "2012-05-01", test_name = c("CHLOROPHYLLA-SALINE",
      "SALINITY"))
```

#### Operate on raw data
```
raw_data <- get_wq(station_id = "FLAB08", date_min = "2011-03-01", 
      date_max = "2012-05-01", test_name = "CHLOROPHYLLA-SALINE", raw = TRUE)

clean_wq(raw_data)
```

### Hydrologic data
Station IDs and date ranges can be viewed in the [Environmental Monitoring Location Maps](https://www.sfwmd.gov/documents-by-tag/emmaps). 

#### Identify unique time series (dbkeys) before-hand
```
get_dbkey(stationid = "C111%", stat = 'MEAN', category = "WQ", detail.level = "full")
get_hydro(dbkey = 38104, date_min = "2009-01-01", date_max = "2009-01-12")
```

#### Pass station info on-the-fly
```
get_hydro(date_min = "2013-01-01", date_max = "2013-02-02",
         stationid = "JBTS", category = "WEATHER", param = "WNDS",
         freq = "DA", stat = "MEAN", recorder = "CR10", agency = "WMD")
```

#### Operate on raw data
```
raw_data <- get_hydro(date_min = "2013-01-01", date_max = "2013-02-02",
         stationid = "JBTS", category = "WEATHER", param = "WNDS",
         freq = "DA", stat = "MEAN", recorder = "CR10", agency = "WMD", raw = TRUE)
         
clean_hydro(raw_data)
```
